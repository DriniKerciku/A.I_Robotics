Kalman filters are used to make predictions based on measurements of sensors and the prior belief on the location of an object. The world is continuous and it is represented by a Gaussian and a simple case is coded under Kalman_Filters(Gaussian).

The matrix class was provided by the course instructor and it is simply used to carry out the mathematical operations to implement a Kalman filter.
